# EasyCrypt
Python script for en/decrypting file using openssl command. Aim of this script is to make en/decryption of files and dirs easier, nothing more, nothing less.

# Requirement
Use Python version higher than 2.7 for unittesting.
If you want to test using Python under version 2.6, then import unittest2 to the scripts.
This project requires no additional modules of Python e.g. PyCrypto, however, uses openssl command instead.
For mac and linux, openssl command is pre-installed but for windows, you need to install openssl so that you can execute this library from command prompt.


# Install
There is no need for installation. Just copy this lib to your environment and run it with your Python.
